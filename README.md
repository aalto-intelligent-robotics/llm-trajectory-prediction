# Exploring Large Language Models for Trajectory Prediction: A Technical Perspective

This repository contains code for the report by F. Munir, T. Mihaylova, S. Azam, T. Kucner, V. Kyrki "Exploring Large Language Models for Trajectory Prediction: A Technical Perspective", LBR at HRI 2024.


## About

The work is based on [GPT-Driver](https://github.com/PointsCoder/GPT-Driver) and uses their provided dataset.

### PEFT

[PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index), or Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a HuggingFace library for adapting pre-trained models without fine-tuning the model parameters.

This repository contains the code for training and inference with [LoRA adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685).

## Setup

### Environment

Install [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). 

Create conda environment:

```
conda create -n python=3.9
```

Install required libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data

We use the dataset provided by the GPT-Driver paper, and we use their training and validation split.

This folder `data` contains the training and validation data in JSON files.

The same files can be obtained by using the raw data from GPT-Driver and running the script `create_data_split.py`.

### Adapter Checkpoints

Download the saved checkpoints for LoRA adapters from the following links and unzip them:

* Llama2-7B: TBA
* Llama2-Chat-7B: TBA
* Mistral: TBA
* Zephyr: TBA
* GPT-2: TBA

In the code, pass the path to the corresponding adapter checkpoint as a parameter `adapter_path` in the script `inference.py`.

## Running the Experiments

### Inference

The script `inference.py` needs to be executed with corresponsing parameters. 
See the file `run_inference.sh` for an example.

### Evaluation

The script `evaluation.py` needs to be executed with corresponsing parameters. 
See the file `run_evaluation.sh` for an example of running evaluation of all files in the output directory.

To save the evaluation results to a file, run:
```
./run_evaluation.sh > results/eval.txt
```

### Training

The script `training.py` needs to be executed with corresponsing parameters. 
See the file `run_training.sh` for an example.
